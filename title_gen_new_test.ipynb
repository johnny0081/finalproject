            "\"[TEXT] When you think of farther up and down the East, you think of this area of California with huge, rich and varied landscapes. But despite having fewer natural attractions and more of an urban-rural setting than many other states, the region is just that big. It's so far ahead of its time, but it's not really getting anywhere fast enough. While some of California's natural attractions include the ocean, the San Francisco Bay, San Gabriel Mountains, the Santa Ana Mountains and the California Wildflowers, much of that land is too remote and too barren for your fancy house. But that's where Los Angeles County's famed landscape is right now, and Los Angeles County residents have the choice to visit it. The beautiful landscape of Los Angeles County is right up your alley. But that didn't stop the owner, Steve Anderson, from giving some advice for the way through. 'Los Angeles County is pretty big,' he told us today. 'It's easy to go past one part of town and go back and you'll get this beautiful landscape. You can come in and there's still the San Fernando Mountains, but you have to drive in along this very narrow highway that you need another 5 miles on the way. You get another 25 miles to your car or another 10 to 20 miles, if you want to enjoy the other 10 miles of the way. You can just drive right as a tourist. And the same goes for the beautiful landscape of Los Angeles County.' It wasn't just the scenery that he got in hand, though. The fact that the area has such a beautiful landscape was also an inspiration for him and his wife, who just finished their honeymoon in the West with their dog, who is now with their daughter. The family recently moved to the LA County region but Anderson wants the region to continue to bring them back together for future adventures. 'It's pretty hard to get a real vacation in the region with all these incredible natural resources. It's like a family movie, right? It's that simple. We love it.' LA County is so far ahead of its time, though the region is just that big. It's just that big, and that's where Los Angeles County has a much larger population than much of California. Los Angeles County has a population density of a staggering 8.7 people per square mile, an impressive 1.3 million square miles below that of other states, with roughly 200,000 people of each class coming together every year for every person who does. And, in terms of transportation, it's not far from the Bay Area or the Pacific Crest Trail, which have populations of between 1.8 and 3.4 million people each year. Los Angeles County is so far ahead of its time, but it's not really getting anywhere fast enough to be on the map. This isn't an article about the landscape or whether it's the most beautiful or least impressive. This is about how we can enjoy our days in the bay.' This article was featured in the San Francisco Bay in 2008. Los Angeles County resident Steve Anderson is leading another trip to Los Angeles County. As we approach the San Fernando Valley at the end of our stay, we'll be able to spot an amazing beach, the LA National Aquarium and the LA City Lights. So, it's time we look further. If the beach offers more than enough to make you want to visit, there's enough to make sure you're back at the beach before you're disappointed. If the beach offered more, there's enough to make them back at the beach before you're disappointed. In any case, it has to be the perfect backdrop for your trip. This is the same region where, on our trip, we spotted the city of San Francisco . As we approach the Bay, the city was just as lovely as the ocean and the San Francisco Bay, also known as the \"Great SF\" or \"San Francisco Bay.\" While the ocean is spectacular, the sea is also quite desolate and is not an attractive setting for your trip. If this is anything to eat, try to avoid the city. If it's one of your favorite spots, there are plenty of hotels and motels in the area to indulge you in. But if you want to enjoy more of LA County, then you have to head north. We found San Francisco where we were able to find plenty of hotels and motels in San Francisco and even the LA Center. The LA County area also boasts an amazing sunset and gorgeous scenery,\n",

Pictured, a chain will also offer emergency home support services in order to combat a massive food shortage or provide affordable housing among other things. The chain is expected to expand to around the world this year, as ministers look to help people avoid food insecurity. At present, in the UK, nearly 5million people are in a food gap. The £4,000 cost of a food bank runs from £1,250 for a single person to £1,500 for each family member . The £6,500 cost of a food bank runs from £9,000 for each child to £4,500 for each parent . At present, the £9,000 cost of a food bank runs from £1,250 for a single person to £4,500 for each family member or parents . At least two other health chains already offer food banks, with the current one offering first-aid services for children. Tesco, which makes breakfast cereals on offer, are among the first to offer their first-aid kits. And in London, a new charity is encouraging mothers to try out new medicines and give them a month's supply of antibiotics before starting a new pregnancy . 'This has become a major source of funding for the NHS, and will be a vital part of the funding of the NHS until we stop this epidemic,' said Michael J Williams, the charity leader and spokesman for Stop The Food Bank.

            " —, which had the power to make a profit, was the main reason for selling these to her boyfriend, who was 'too busy raising money for the family' for her son. 'A lot of people love the idea of people getting a piece of the pie. But we believe it's better to do that with the help of our partners now that we have access to new technology than when you have to give up on a job,' Ms Deaton told BBC Three. 'That's because we have a lot more flexibility. 'We are able to offer you a bigger slice of a slice of the pie. We hope that by giving you greater opportunity in this relationship, we can create a more joyful and balanced relationship.' Mr Burda claims he is 'thriv'd' by what he has seen in his 'very happy' relationship in the past and claims he now feels the relationship 'is no longer acceptable'. At his new home in Brighton, Surrey, his mum, Katherine, and son, Jack, 10, were delighted to see the three men - which had their real estate license plates - being registered by the firm. The couple have both been on the register of a private company, which takes ownership of the three men and uses it to pay their legal bills. In the past he says that he would pay around £25,000 to help his wife with her real estate business before moving on to a partnership with  his partner of 15 years, David, who will be his real estate partner. Mr Burda claims he had gone from being a successful business manager to a success after being 'truly unhappy' in the past, and he has given his life to a business he says is 'absolutely the best in the world'. Mr Burda was offered a new career as an independent contractor but had to give up his 'freedom' to work for a company called B2B (B2B) which deals in construction, insurance, catering and residential property. It was the first time he has seen a deal involving a company that would be valued at more than £25M, he is pleased it ended with this offer, and that the new arrangement was a success. Mr Burda was previously one of three boys with a private company for which he gave up his freedom to work. Mr Burda claims his partner became annoyed with him after he saw a 'lack of trust' which he felt was too great an opportunity. 'Once the deal was over, I was left feeling humiliated and embarrassed,' Mr Burda told the BBC. 'I would go on to work with other boys to pay rent, or work more for myself. 'I remember it was a very happy day in my family holiday. I sat down for dinner and I said: 'What can I do instead of giving up my freedom to work? We are not going to take over. Is it better for someone else.' Mr Burda's future in his new partnership with the firm has not been determined, and he hopes that when he moves to another country, the firm will offer him an opportunity to help with his family's mortgage account. Mr Burda said: 'I feel very happy. 'I think it's the right thing to do in a very honest, happy way.' Mr Burda believes he has a 'completely different and very different' attitude to the current, turbulent relationship. Mr Burda said: 'I had been in such a really good relationship since I was 12-years-old and I'm quite proud of it because the one thing I've learned from my relationship is I have to respect that - there is no point in being unhappy. 'When people don't give you a chance to make a big progress, if that's not something they will complain about, then I will.' Mr Burda believes B2B's work is 'the best in the world'. 'I see it as a way of working with other boys. I've had an opportunity from the family to work for B2B to help build their business,' he said. 'In other companies you get this kind of opportunity to help other boys. 'When B2B said I had to work for 3-yrs-old he said: 'Well can I do it? That is what you can do with your money. 'I was amazed by his answer, he really understood what I was really pushing for. I don't think it was a big misunderstanding.' Mr Burda said he had worked for the company for two years and had never felt threatened by the new work arrangement. 'I have also always wanted to work for an independent business but if I've worked at a big firm I am not sure which ones.' He added: 'Some of my previous jobs were with the charity but B2B now works on behalf of the family which is why I am doing my own business. 'I am also going to raise a lot of money for an independent charity and I am happy with the outcome of the business\n",

The man, of course, had already gone the extra mile - it was no secret the date was the only party he could plan for when he met Ms Cushman in April this year. He is just behind his idol in the men's survey of UK men, as he has a 16 per cent female opinion of him and a 12 per cent male opinion of him. And, when asked if he would consider having another date a day or two later, he replied: 'Yes! I can see where that comes from. If I decide before it, and not then, that it's worth pursuing, then I'll consider it, and do the rest with as little risk as I can.' Mr Cushman, who made his debut at the age of 19 in 1999, will miss tonight's game with Middlesbrough, when he is assessed for playing time following the ankle ligament surgery, before being assessed for making the final three for Sheffield-Bankhead in October. Scroll down for video . He says: 'I'm on my way! It's been my dream for a long time. I've dreamt it all.' And, as he prepares to make the final three for Middlesbrough, Mr Cushman has also announced his desire to become a DJ. A DJ is a dance music producer or producer who plays with other people on stage. The man goes by the name of Kicks, and has become the number one DJs in the country on a personal scale . The man has not revealed how long he's been in the limelight since Mr Cushman's arrival, but his friends and family have long had a taste for the former DJ on his music. He is also close with Mr Cushman, who first met him in March 2012 after they went to visit friends in the house and began to enjoy his music in September 2012. Mr Cushman said: 'Kicks was my favourite DJ from the beginning.' Mr Cushman was introduced by DJ David Miller and Mr Cushman became the DJ duo after he received a letter from Mr Miller telling him that there had been no previous talks with him and there was not going to be any talks after that. The pair were lucky to find each other in October, so they will be making arrangements soon. They made it to a meeting for a show at the Bistro in London before Mr Cushman announced his end in October, and it has gone well together. Mr Cushman has now admitted to Miss Cushman that he is 'not quite ready yet to break out the dancefloor'. The DJ has now come out in the music industry in an apparent attempt to make up for his loss in the music industry after just two years there . A friend of Mr Cushman was said to be a fan after going through an interview before their visit to meet him at Mr Miller's club. Cushman, who was at the dinner, has since said he is not sure if he has any plans to go to the DJ company this month. He has said: 'No, I would only take a second job if I could. I could make it with a DJ.' Cushman and Miss Cushman, pictured in October at the club, are close to each other. Mr Cushman has decided not to meet with Miss Cushman\n",

Now, as it celebrates a half century on, as the prize has been awarded to a Chinese team as part of its peacekeeping missions in the Middle East, China hopes to send a message not to disrespect the honor but to recognise its achievements. The medal, which was given by China's military chief General Shen Chunlin, is now held in Xi'an, the central city of Nanjing. It was given to the team by the Nobel Committee in the United States and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which conducted the contest on behalf of the Chinese people. The Chinese military chief, General Shen Chunlin, congratulated the winners at  Changsha Airbase, the capital of China . Shen Chunlin gestures to the audience while standing with the prize at the start of the ceremony . It was given to the team by the United Nations after Shen's son, who has not yet revealed his identity, won the prize last year. The medals were given out at a ceremony in Hanxi Province, central China. 'The Chinese government recognised the prize in 2012 and the winner of 2014,' the Chinese military said in a brief statement. 'In 2012, the National People's Congress (CPC) held a vote on national elections and that vote went overwhelmingly to President Xi Jinping, so the China campaign will be ongoing.' Shen Chunlin has been fighting a bitter battle to save the award since arriving in Beijing when the nation's military launched an unprecedented military campaign aimed at winning what it said was their right to an honorary medal. Beijing has claimed that the award was wrongly awarded to China as it had received two of the most decorated generals since the Second World War. General Shen Chunlin, who is in Nanjing to promote the initiative, said the awarding of the medal was an honour 'to honour China's achievements in the past three decades', as well as to acknowledge the achievements of the country's military. China's military has been responsible for more than 6,700 operations worldwide, most of which involved ground forces and specialised paramilitary police forces. Their missions include carrying out ground and air attacks, targeting militant groups and protecting homes and businesses from terrorist attacks. Shen said China was considering the award as a good tribute to the 'great achievements of Chinese military leaderships' and emphasized that the awards give 'the Chinese people hope and inspiration that they will be able to accomplish something great in this very short period of time'. 'At the same time', he added, 'that China is also pleased to share that it won the award for its military achievements in the past three decades.' The medal was given to the team by the United Nations, the Nobel Committee in the United States and the China Academy of Sciences, which conducted the contest on behalf of the Chinese people .\"\t\"[SUMMARY] The Chinese military has been fighting a fierce battle to have the highest number of medals for three decades .\n",

The families of three victims of the 2008 attack that left a New Zealand woman dead in her home village in Aotearoa, west of Aotearoa, are to appear at Auckland Magistrates' Court tomorrow. A victim's daughter, the daughter of the alleged killer's first husband, is in the dock accused of her murder after the attack, but was freed at the Wellington District Court because of her mental health problems. She told a police interview that her mother was told her baby's father Robert and his wife, the third person killed. The father and three sisters were killed in the horrific scene when the body of four boys, all from Aotearoa, was found last week. A murder trial is expected to take place later this month. Former partner of killer James 'Jack' Brown, 43, and his daughter Amanda, are to appear at Auckland Magistrates' Court on Monday before appearing for her husband, Cheshire Crown Prosecutor Detective Inspector Simon Poulter . A teenage boy, eight years old, is to appear at Auckland Magistrates' Court at the end of May . The couple are also being offered bail during the trial as they are accused of killing the father and another man by a 'gangster' in Aotearoa's town of Derry, North Kildare last week . The trial is set to last some two years and the mother of Robert's daughter, Amanda Poulter, is due to appear at Auckland Magistrates' Court on Monday . Mr Brown, 43, and his partner are accused of killing the mother and her infant son, Rama, after they lured him into the forest in Rama's mother's home in Aotearoa and set him alight. He was the suspect in the murder of his father when he was last seen at home in Aotearoa in September 2007. At the time he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been living at his parents' home in the town with a partner. In February 2006 Mr Brown, who has previous convictions for burglary, arson and murder, was arrested by police in New Zealand in Aotearoa. His wife, the mother of two, is now in hospital. She said: 'What really changed me was my mother told me. 'It wasn't just her telling me. She was telling me that she loved me and she loved Rama so she would kill me. 'I don't know how I feel now, but I wish we had been together. 'I know it will be tough for my family for them to fight for us but it just so happens that they are now so close and so close.' The mother of Rama was seen by her mother-to-be at home in Rama's village, Aotearoa, in 2007 and was arrested last week after she had left her mother's mobile phone and her wallet inside while a manhunt was focused on her. A manhunt was also mounted in New Zealand to trace her mother as she left a bank to see her newborn son, who has been put into foster care since her son was born . A police officer on a street in Rama's village, Aotearoa, in 2007. He said that while he did not know her name, he knows the two families as well as her sister Rama's. The police officer on the street, who cannot be named, and a search group were on the site where he had found Rama's phone. His search was also led to the man who had killed Robert Brown and Robert Brown's father. The man is accused of the killings of his father Robert and his baby Rama. The teenager's father of Robert Brown, 43, is facing murder charges in the September 2007 killing of his father . The victim of Rama's murder, Rama, is pictured at the end of a police interview last year . Mr Brown, who was charged with his role in the slaying of Robert Brown, was freed at The Wellington District Court following his own confession last month. On Monday he will appear in Auckland Magistrates' Court again after his trial is concluded. The pair have been accused of murder, arson and murder in the killing of a young man, Rama (left) in 2007 .

            " Arabic or the 'Islamic State' ISIS and al-Nusra Front had carried out three and a half years of brutal warfare against the Syrian army. The Syrian government and its military are also accused of providing the chemical weapons, which has left the international community with a collective shock after years of heavy U.S. sanctions aimed at providing support for the so-called 'moderate' rebel groups. According to a report by The Associated Press, Syria's air force, which is based in the country's southeast, has launched airstrikes on the militant groups. The report added that the coalition has conducted a heavy weapons campaign against militants, with at least 10 confirmed air strikes over three years. The airstrikes have also killed dozens of militants and destroyed equipment and weapons caches used by the militants. Meanwhile, a video purportedly by ISIS claimed by the militant group, posted online, uploaded to an audio channel on the militant group's official website, showed the Syrian government sending airstrikes to support the army. While the video has been viewed by more than 260,000 people, the video uploaded by ISIS on its Twitter account appears to show Syrian soldiers firing a projectile at an ISIS checkpoint. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Syria has denied allegations from the U.S.-lead coalition. In one video, seen by Reuters, the Syrian soldier, wearing a black jacket, appears to point a gun at an ISIS flag and ask for help. The U.S.-led coalition has accused a senior opposition leader of helping facilitate the war. Syrian military officials have accused ISIS, which has seized a number of cities in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa in recent weeks, of using the chemical weapons it has allegedly used against the Syrian military.\"\t\"[SUMMARY] Footage appears to show Syrian soldiers firing a projectile at an ISIS checkpoint .\n",

The NFC West playoff race will be one of the most heavily watched in the sport, with its own NFC wild card and six head coaches. With four games remaining, only two of those will be up for grabs as the playoffs open up. With no guaranteed title and an AFC South berth on the line, it's no surprise that the team that has been chasing a playoff berth has been on a tear. Now, however, it's time for the Giants to see if the rivalry can be revived as a whole. First off, let's get down to business - the team that beat the Vikings to extend their playoff dreams . The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Miami Dolphins in the season opener . 'I'm not surprised that it's not the same NFC West we had in the 1990s. There is a lot of excitement about it,' New York Giants co-chief operating officer Steve Bisciotti told us. 'The anticipation is really growing for the league next year. 'There's going to be two teams that can do it: The ones that won and the ones that went undefeated.' With the regular season just over two weeks away, the NFC will be making all three rounds in order to finish off the year strong and give the team a significant boost in the standings. That can only be a good thing, if the Giants are able to mount a winning push against the NFC playoff picture. 'They're still going to have to get on the same page and work on some things,' Bisciotti said. 'When you start down the road, we like to play on the same page, because there are a lot of similarities between ourselves and everybody else, but what you see in the end is that this is pretty special. 'The NFC East is probably the closest thing, but what we're playing on the same page here is really important.' The Eagles will look to put the team on a winning streak after finishing first in the division in 2014 in a bid to avoid elimination from the playoffs. This week marks one of two years, one year and one year, in which the Eagles have not secured themselves into the playoffs. The Eagles have won the NFC West and playoff games in each of the first two years, but the 2013 NFC Championship Game came down to the last minute. Eagles head coach Chip Kelly and teammates look to win the NFC East . The Eagles haven't had a winning streak in 11 years and one of their most successful franchises. In just one year they've won the Superbowl, the NFC championship, the Super Bowl XLIX and all the way down to last place in Super Bowl XLVI. So what can be rebuilt from the ashes of that year? They've done it in a way that has not been seen before in the franchise's history, however. The club has come closer than any team to being\n",

The couple have a son, Jack, 15, and have been in 'charity work', raising awareness of their son's problems but have been in trouble for failing to turn their lives around. But Michael and Daniel have been given a new lease of life by Samantha after their daughter Jodi started growing strong, thanks to their efforts to help out with the costs of the delivery of her first son. The duo said they were determined to continue to support their son's 'truly incredible' birth and Samantha is now giving birth to her second son, Jack, and their baby's mother is now giving birth to their third child, Jodi. Jodi's story starts in 1999 when Michael and Daniel's daughter, Samantha Jodi, aged 15, was born. Michael was given a pacemaker so his heart stopped beating. Daniel was told by his mother to start CPR before having the baby delivered, but when the baby was born Daniel and Timothy, 13, rushed to give it good news. The couple are now giving birth to both his sons, Jack and Jodi, 11 and 12 . Jodi's story starts in 1999 when Michael and Daniel's daughter, Samantha, aged 15, was born. A pacemaker was put in their pacemaker so the heart stopped beating . It was then Michael and Daniel thought she wouldn't stop pumping, so Samantha gave the baby a pacemaker. The couple said they are continuing to try to help Samantha but she is now giving birth to her second son Jack, 11-month-old Jack, 11-month-old Samantha-Jodi, 11/12. Samantha Jodi has since given birth to her third son, Jack, 11 months later . The couple said they are now giving birth to both their sons, Jack and Jodi, 11 and 12, at 4am tomorrow . Daniel, who said Daniel has been so happy with her caretaker boyfriend, said: 'He is in love with me - he is very proud of my work. 'He has always been here but he is the kindest guy and he is very nice. Samantha Jodi, who had just three deliveries together on the previous baby day, said: 'I would love to be his mum but unfortunately this is a long road for him.' Daniel had no idea that his mother would have her second child until the couple, who moved into a four-bedroom house on a street near the city of Gullworth, East London, in August last year, bought it for him. Daniel had been hoping she would become a mother and he couldn't wait to share her joy with his children in this very special moment in time. Samantha Jodi gave birth to her third son Jack, 11 months after the birth of his first son . The couple have since given birth to both their boys, Jack and Jodi, 11 months later .

Authorities have not yet identified the person who committed the crimes, though investigators believe the suspect may be white, according to Fox News. In 2012, the suspect was charged with assault and burglary with a deadly weapon. The suspect is suspected of burglarizing a home, police say. A neighbor identified the officer as the man who threw the three victims out the window. Police said the officer told the victim that someone was trying to break into the home and that a home should stop. The police officer told the victim, \"\"I thought somebody could take me in there, that I needed to let them know that there was a gun,\"\" according to the Post.

            " donations and donations made before the scandal was exposed, the president allegedly used the 'bog of war' money to 'mock the media', even when the reporter in question is a former CIA analyst, The Washington Times reported. The revelations come as a major scandal in this administration has dragged its heels in years spent reining in and out of the Iraq 'lone wolf' administration by President Obama. On the heels of the scandal is a new round of Obama Administration sanctions that have limited or stopped funding for the CIA. It means the U.S. would have to buy weapons and equipment from abroad rather than face the same tough scrutiny it now faces if it were to get rid of the terrorist mastermind in Yemen, a senior CIA official told CBS. Meanwhile, an ongoing investigation has found dozens of CIA and other agencies have been caught using a massive cyber security program to infiltrate targets, stealing valuable email addresses, and sending foreign spy agents in exchange for political favors. The Obama administration had promised it wouldn't use federal criminal law while it negotiated the deal without congressional approval. However, recent reports show a growing threat to both CIA and NSA funding and spending. CIA whistleblower James Woolsey said the NSA is now 'a private sector company' for years before the program was suspended in December 2012. And former President Bill Clinton was accused of using the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program against Democratic congressman and U.S. Sen. Edward J. Kennedy 'for the purposes of collecting information about John Kerry, who is running for President, and was in Yemen in the late 1970s.' And in response to the report, one of his top CIA colleagues is now demanding the president give up US funding and arms. On Wednesday, it was reported that John Brennan, the president's chief U.S. counterterrorism adviser, has reportedly resigned from his post. State Department spokesman Mark Toner says that Brennan has 'remained at the forefront of the project' and is 'ready to carry out his missions'. It is unclear if Brennan had 'serious security reasons' for leaving before the report was released. But he has reportedly 'lifted his focus to the work that the project brings to the Middle East' as he heads into the final months of his tenure. In one of his tweets Monday, Obama 'spoke eloquently' about the role ISIS had played in the terror threat to 'our friends the United States and its allies' In his speech before Congress, Barack Obama said the US would 'go to the negotiating table' if it was serious about stopping the terror threat. Earlier Wednesday US President Barack Obama, who has seen his first budget gutted by Congress last month, said the United States is ready 'to face this threat and go forward with the fight'. The White House is set to unveil its final budget in mid-April without releasing a single page. But that is not necessarily making the administration any safer. Last year, the White House budget was less than half the size of the Obama administration's last budget in 2010. The Obama administration's budget has fallen nearly as much as the GOP, according to the Washington Times. It was also less than the size of President Obama's last budget for the White House during the same period in the same period in 2007. 'As a whole, the new president has to be able to make some decisions,' said former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. 'He can't have one decision that comes straight off of the table. And that doesn't mean that he should have to weigh political considerations and take action.' Republican Senator Bob Corker said in a statement: 'I am deeply disappointed that it has taken Obama to an entire generation and so many others to ignore the warnings of the president that this 'terror campaign' is far from successful.' But Republicans argue the president doesn't have a rational basis for acting in this way and wants a balanced effort. The president hasn't ruled out joining forces with the CIA, and would still insist the CIA has its own counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies that are dedicated to 'determined missions' on the ground. He also said the administration can't 'waste a year or two of this administration' trying to bring any kind of counterterrorism expertise directly under his command. As to the matter of a ban on using drones for counterterrorism, the head of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said last week that 'the evidence indicates that we would not allow that at all.' The chairwoman of the committee, Dianne Feinstein of California, also echoed President Obama's comments and called for the CIA to stop using Predator drones. 'We have a responsibility to do what is right and prudent, but I am not going to tell you that the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency and the Director of National Intelligence will each agree to abide by this order,' Feinstein said. Brennan (left) said Wednesday during a congressional hearing that Americans should be concerned about American lives . The White House has been under fire for months this year over the White House's position on drones and the recent comments were the\n",

The 27-year-old was found in the Waterstone Lake on Tuesday, after his car was submerged in a creek. The two men, whose names are due to be released as early as Tuesday, have been charged with burglary, larceny and weapons possession. When officers were called to the Lake, around 1:40am Tuesday they found the driver's side door cracked and glass on his driveway, it is alleged. Scroll down for video . After his death police have announced the driver is thought to be the father, brother and father-in-law of the man. He had allegedly used the home as a home or place of business. Police were called to the Lake, around 1:40am Tuesday, because the vehicle was submerged in a creek, which was said to have appeared to be a 'possession offence'. When police officers were called to the Lake, around 1:40am Tuesday they found the driver's side door cracked. CCTV footage taken at a nearby home with The Lake  is now being analysed. The 'possession of the firearms, drugs, drugs paraphernalia and other dangerous drugs' is understood to have been made possible by the burglary charge, and is believed to have led to the crash of the home, which was in a residential neighbourhood . The 27-year-old had a broken wrist and wrist sprain in his hands. The three suspected accomplices, who were taken to the Waterstone Lake, are being questioned along with a fourth man. Police are appealing for information leading to the arrest of the suspects. It follows a police investigation into the fatal crash in the Waterstone Lake where two men were killed in separate car crashes on Sunday. In a chilling chilling video of the scene, which was released in New South Wales and Victoria, Detective Sergeant Nick McCallum told the men to 'take down all of the firearms and the drugs'. ‘All their drugs, all their drugs, all their weapons and drugs are all seized,’ he said. ‘So now that's it. I’m telling you what I did to the car. I took all of that from that car. And then I got the gun in it so it was no surprise that it had a serial number. ‘This is the kind of crime we're talking about here. But it’s not the first time we've had some problems. ‘To say this was a homicide where the suspect was shot or killed was one of the worst things you’ve ever heard of. He was really good. I was just a good kid. It wasn’t really a homicide. He was going through the streets in a street. So it was a very, very tragic situation. ‘It was a robbery. You’ve never done it like this before? You think about what just happened. I was driving my car but I didn’t really pay much attention to the road. There were loads of cars and I got back to the car and that was a devastating moment. People were screaming. People were hitting the side of the road but nobody was injured. It was a very, very tragic situation.\"\t\"[SUMMARY] In footage from a nearby home, suspects can be seen taking off the  car .\n",

            "\"[TEXT] (CNN)Back in 2012, a man in his mid-40s was arrested by police after allegedly knocking a woman on the head with a baseball bat. The suspect, identified as 39-year-old Lorne Wany, was arrested after the woman's grandmother called police and said she had been attacked by the unidentified man on Thursday. The man allegedly can be seen swinging a bat at the woman, who was knocked unconscious, according to the New York Daily News. The woman, who does not want to be named for legal reasons, said she was knocked unconscious after the alleged assault, police say. She told police she suffered from multiple sclerosis and was unable to walk properly and was in a wheelchair, according to the New York Daily News. \"\"\n",

Speaking to airline officials, it was learnt that the crew was unable to manage constant pullouts and changes in the roster.  “Both, pilots and cabin crew are overworked and yet to receive the pay hike that has been promised for several months now,” another airline official said.  The information about crew shortage has been floating since last year. Air India pilots, in fact, in December had threatened strike over long working hours and unfair compensation by the management.  In a letter written to the Air India management, pilots alleged that Air India has been hiring Expat pilots with 80% salary hikes whereas their salaries have not been restored to the pre-COVID levels.  Expat pilots come at a higher cost compared to those pilots working in India.  In November last year, the Tata group-owned Air India announced plans to hire expat pilots for its Boeing 777 planes as the airline is facing a shortage of pilots amid plans to expand its fleet as well as international operations.\n",
